## EmotionScanner-Frontend

Welcome to the EmotionScanner-Frontend repository, a vital piece of the EmotionScanner project developed during my academic journey. This project represents a user-facing web application designed to interact with the EmotionScanner's Backend, providing a seamless and intuitive interface for real-time emotion recognition from facial expressions.

### Features

* **User Interface**: A clean and responsive design that enhances user experience and engagement.
* **Real-time Interaction**: Integrates with the backend for instant emotion recognition and feedback.
* **Accessibility**: Designed with accessibility in mind to cater to a wide range of users.
* **Responsive Design**: Ensures a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

### Technologies

* **Svelte**: Utilized for its reactivity and compactness, making the application fast and efficient.
* **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsive design, ensuring a modern look and feel.
* **Web APIs**: Use of modern Web APIs for real-time video processing and display.

### Getting Started

To get the frontend up and running on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/EmotionScanner-Frontend.git


2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd EmotionScanner-Frontend
   npm install

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

 Access the web application at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Deployment

This frontend application is designed to work in conjunction with the EmotionScanner-Backend. Ensure that the backend service is running and accessible for full functionality.

Note: This repository hosts the frontend part of the EmotionScanner project. The backend, which is responsible for processing and analyzing the image data, is maintained in a separate repository: EmotionScanner-Backend.
